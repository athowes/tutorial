## Learning python as an R user

Linking to vignette or quick-start resources where possible:

* The PyData ecosystem, including: [`Numpy`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html), `Scipy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-Learn`, `NLTK`, `PyMC`, `Numba`, and `Blaze`
* Plotting in python is limited, stick to R
  * `Seaborn` and `altair` are okay
  * Could learn [Observable `plot`](https://observablehq.com/)
* `bambi` as a `brms` interface; `PyMC`, `NumPyro` or `cmdstanpy` for writing Bayesian models; `Scikit-Learn` for ML; `Jax` or `PyTorch` over `Tensorflow for NNs
